My name is Ali A. Faruqi. I am a bioinformatician by training and have a Masters in Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology from Imperial College, London. I have worked as a researcher at University of California, San Francisco and am interested in managing the development of deep-learning based products for biomedical purposes.
