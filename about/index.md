My name is Ali A. Faruqi. I am a bioinformatician by training and have a Masters in Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology from Imperial College, London. I have worked as a researcher at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and am interested in managing the development of deep-learning based products for biomedical purposes. 

I follow what I call a publish-as-you-go model. The idea is to make publicly whatever little I have done and keep on posting more results as and when they come. I think this approach is good for a number of reasons:

1. Waiting time is reduced. One does not have wait really long in order to have something to share with the world.
2. Feedback is quick, making the whole process of iterative research fast. Interested people can read, comment, criticize, point out mistakes and overall help in improving one’s direction of research.
3. There is no fear being scooped. Whatever you are doing is out there for the world to see almost as soon as you are done.

Since I don’t work in academia anymore and my daytime job has nothing to do with scientific research for product development, I’m a pure hobbyist and machine/deep-learning enthusiast. 

I don’t have any financial support for my work or a core group of people to work with. I’m reaching out to people to work and/or collaborate. If you are interested, please let me know. I’d be more than happy to talk further.

Cheers!
