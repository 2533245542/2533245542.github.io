<p align="justify"><b>1) Phylogenetic Tree </b></p>
<p align="justify">The phylogenetic tree obtained using the 23S rRNA sequences of the 141 organisms contained an additional organism, the Archaea, <i>Thermoplasma acidophilum</i>, as an out-group. The reason for using an out-group was to root the tree and obtain a more realistic phylogenetic relationship of the organisms. The rooted tree with the out-group is shown in Figure 1. </p>

<p><center><b>Figure 1: Rooted 23rRNA phylogenetic tree using the out-group. The numbers at the internal nodes represent the bootstrap values. Click on thumbnail for full-view.</b></center></p>
<p align="justify">After rooting the tree, the out-group was removed to yield a tree containing only the organisms relevant for this analysis. The new tree obtained, thus, is shown in Figure 2. The removal of the out-group does not significantly change the topology of the tree. Most of clades remain the same. Only a few clades are changed, based on the absence of the out-group. For example, the clade belonging to genus <i>Mycoplasma</i> becomes more evolutionary distant than other clades, in the absence of the out-group. This is agreeable in light of biological knowledge, as <i>Mycoplasma</i> lack a cell wall, which represents a significant evolutionary event to separate their lineage from bacteria possessing a cell wall [6]. </p>

<p align="justify"><b>2) Distribution of Organisms and Reactions </b></p>
<p align="justify">The data obtained from the database about the number and types of organisms and reaction was integrated with data about the habitat and respiration types of organisms. Figures 3 and 4 present the distribution histograms of organisms based on their habitat and respiration types, respectively. </p>

<p><center><b>Figure 4: Distribution histogram of organisms based on their mode of respiration. Click thumbnail for full-view</b></center></p>
<p align="justify">As can be seen from Figure 3, most of the organisms that have fewer than 700 reactions are host-associated. The highest peak in the distribution is between the range 1100 and 1200. Most organisms have metabolic reactions present within this range. In terms of respiration, Figure 4 shows a more mixed response wherein there is no clear cut pattern between the number of reactions present in organisms and modes of respiration. Organisms have different types of respirations within all ranges of reactions. </p>
<p align="justify">The distribution of number of organisms per reaction is presented in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5, most of reactions present in the database are unique and present only in a handful of organisms. Similarly, the reactions common in all 141 organisms are quite few in number. </p>

<p align="justify"><b>3) Ancestral State Reconstruction</b></p>
<p align="justify">Ancestral state reconstruction was performed on the tree shown in Figure 2. A total of 30 metabolic reactions were present in all the 141 bacteria. The software used to perform ancestral state reconstruction, Mesquite, did not include these reactions. The reason for not including these reactions is be based on the assumption that the presence of a reaction in all extant bacteria gives strong evidence for its presence in their last common ancestor. As a consequence, the comparison of gain/loss was made for 2526 reactions.</p>
<p align="justify">Each branch in the phylogeny consists of two nodes. One node is the parent (ancestor) node and other node is the child (descendant) node. In order to assess the gain and loss of reactions from an ancestor to its descendant, δP values were calculated. The δP values were obtained through the following formula proposed by Dr. John Pinney:</p>
<p><center><b>&delta;P = P(node)<sub>child</sub> - P(node)<sub>parent</sub></b></center></p>
<p align="justify">P(node)<sub>child</sub> and P(node)<sub>parent</sub> values were obtained for the probabilities of presence of a reaction. Therefore, a δP value close to 1 indicated the gain of a reaction and δP value close to -1 indicated a loss of reaction.</p>
<p align="justify">There are a total of 140 internal (parent) nodes in the phylogeny. Each node gives rise to 2 branches. There are, hence, a total of 280 branches. δP values are calculated for all the branches. Each branch has a total of 2526 δP values corresponding to each of the reaction present in the character matrix. Therefore, there are a total of 707,280 δP values (280 x 2526) for the entire phylogeny for each of the binary trait considered. </p>
<p align="justify">Figure 8 shows the distribution of δP values. The frequency of the occurrence of δP values is presented on a log10 scale. As can be observed from Figure 8, a significant proportion of δP values fall between the range of 0.9 and 1. The same holds true for the opposite tail of distribution. </p>
<p><center><a href="css-javascripts/images/figures/figure8.png" target="_blank"><img src="css-javascripts/images/figures/tn_figure8.png"></a></center></p>
<p><center><b>Figure 8: Distribution of δP values represented in log10 scale. Click thumbnail for full-view</b></center></p>
<p align="justify">Using a threshold δP value of 0.9, ancestral state reconstruction predicted a total of 10,396 gain and loss events. δP = -0.9 (loss) had 5001 events and δP = +0.9 (gain) had 5395 events.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>4) Summarization of gain and loss events on phylogenetic tree</b></p>
<p align="justify">The gain and loss of metabolic reactions, based on the aforementioned δP threshold, are summarized on the phylogenetic tree using a colour scale. Figure 9 shows the results for the gain of reactions and Figure 10 shows the results for the loss of reactions.</p>
<p><center><a href="css-javascripts/images/figures/figure9.png" target="_blank"><img src="css-javascripts/images/figures/tn_figure9.png"></a></center></p>

<p><center><b>Figure 10: Loss of reactions using δP value threshold value of -0.9. Click thumbnail for full-view</b></center></p>
<p align="justify">The branches are coloured based on the number of reactions gained or lost. A branch is coloured dark red if it has lost or gained the maximum number reactions in the entire phylogeny and a branch is coloured dark blue if it has lost or gained the minimum number of reactions in the entire phylogeny. Branches having values ranging between the minimum and maximum are coloured using a continuous colour scale. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>5) Comparison of reaction-based phylogeny with RNA phylogeny</b></p>
<p align="justify">A phylogeny was constructed using the character matrix of metabolic traits, to have a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships as revealed through ancestral state reconstruction results. Figure 11 shows the consensus tree obtained based on the metabolic profiles of the organisms. </p>
